***Dragon City Tips & Tricks For Beginners***

Dragon City is a free-to-play game that has been around for a few years now. It’s a city builder where you get to build a bustling metropolis by making decisions about what to build and how to use the resources that you have available to you.

You’re not limited to just building buildings. You can also buy and sell things, manage your citizens, or even go on adventures. You can also play online with other people from all over the world.

If you’ve never played this game before, you might be wondering what the best way to start is. There are lots of guides that can help you out, but I thought that I would give you my own tips and tricks that will make it easier for you to get started.

When you first start playing, you’ll need to buy some starting gold. You can buy this by clicking on the “Buy” button in the bottom right hand corner of the screen. Once you have enough gold, you should be able to click on the “Build” button and then select “City Building”. This will bring up a menu where you can select what you want to build and how much you want to spend on it. I’ll be talking more about the different things that you can build later in this article, but for now I want to talk about the resources that you will need. In the early game, you won’t need much of these, but as your city gets bigger, you’ll need to collect them. The resources are divided into three categories:

Basic Resources These are the most common resources that you’ll need. They are required in order to build almost everything in the game, and they are also needed to unlock the “Unlock All” option in the game.

***How do you get unlimited gems on Dragon City?***


You have to complete the daily tasks at the farm. The farm is the place where you’ll find the dragons.

In order to have the ability to feed the dragons, you need to collect food from the farms around Dragon City. This can take a while because there are so many farms to go through.

But, if you really want to get free gems every day, the easiest way to do it is to buy a farm farm.

The farm farm is a special type of farm that will give you unlimited gems every day if you complete the daily task for it.

A farm farm is basically just a farm. You’ll find it by traveling to the right side of Dragon City and going to the bottom left hand corner.

Once you’re there, you’ll need to select one of the farms in order to claim it.

You’ll then be able to buy the farm farm for a very small amount of money and then you can start receiving gems.
